# Headings
To create headings we use hash symbols (#) 
We can also create different "level" headings 
To create subheadings, we use multiple hashes


this is a subheading level 2

this is a level 3 subheading

this is 6

# Motifing 
we can use asterisks (*) to modify text style, specifically bold and italics 
I want this **word** to be bold
I want this **word** to be italicized
I want this **word** to be both bold and italicized
This whole sentence is emphasized

aside: Escape Characters
if we want to place a character that is ALREADY a keyword or reserved character we use the back slash (\)

# strikethrough
We can strike through characters or words using the tilde (~)
e.g.
Mr. 

# Link
Links allow us to reference information externally
[A tool **YOU** might use](https://chat.openai.com)
Exercise:
* if you have an open ai account
     * ask chatgpt to make you two links to whatever website using markdown
     * at the end of the links, put down "from chatgpt"
* if you don't
     * create two more links to some other website you think is useful
e.g.
[google link](http://google.com)

[Youtube link](http://youtube.com)

[Roblox link](http://Roblox.com)

# Blockquotes
Block quotes allow us to emphasize a bigger chunk to text.
We use carets (>) to create blockquotes.

e.g.

>this is an example of a blockquote.
>this is line two of blockquotes

>this is the line four of the blockquotes; the thied is blank


# Lists
We can create both unordered and ordered lists

### unordered Lists
To create each point, we use asterisks (\**) with a spare behind it
We can creat a sub portion of the ;ist by placing **TABS**

e.g.
* dairy
    * eggs
    * milk
    * cheese
* juice


### ordered Lists
If there is a speaific order to the lements is our list,
we can create an create an ordered list
We use number, foll


e.g.

1. Put butter into mixing bowl
3. Add sugar to butter (*hold shift to create a second line*)
   Both brown and granulated sugar should be added
4. Using the mixer, cream sugar and butter together
